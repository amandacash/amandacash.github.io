<h1><i class="fas fa-star"></i>THE HISTORY OF SWING STATES<i class="fas fa-star"></i></h1>
<p class="byline">By: Amanda Cash
<p class="intro">
    The first presidential election between Democrats and Republicans was in 1856 between Democratic candidate James Buchanan and Republican John C. Fremont. Since civil war times, there has been the idea of “swing states.” A swing state is any state that can be won by either a Democratic or Republican presidential candidate by a <a href="https://www.history.com/news/swing-states-presidential-elections">"swing"</a> in votes. These states are sometimes referred to as battleground or purple states.
    Swing states are not always consistent. These states change based on the demographics and shifting ideologies within them. 
    There are two components of a presidential election: <br> the electoral college and the popular vote. <br><br>

<img class="ivote" src= "images/ivote.jpg" alt="ivote"> <br> <br>
    <strong>The Electoral College</strong> was created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise to whether citizens should vote or to allow Congress to select a leader. It is comprised of <strong> 538 electors </strong> which is the total number of the House of Representatives, Senators and three elctors for Washington, D.C.). There needs to be <strong> 270 votes to win the presidency. </strong> If for some reason neither candidate receives 270 votes, then the election is sent to the House of Represetnatives for a vote.In every state but two (Nebraska and Maine), the candidate who wins the majority of votes, wins the total number of electoral votes. In Nebraska and Maine, voters are assigned by proportional representation. Electors are state-elected officials, party leaders or people with strong affiliation with Presidential cancidates. <strong> The Electoral College determines the President and Vice President of the United States </strong><br><br>
    <strong>The Popular Vote is the total number of all votes </strong>in the states and Washington, D.C. Typically the president wins both the popular vote and the electoral vote but not always the case. There have been 5 presidential elections where the president elect lost <br>the popular vote: 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016 </li></p>

       <p class="kennedytext"><br><br>Election Day: Tuesday November 8, 1960 <br><br>This election was one of the closest presidential elections in United States history. This was the first election where all fifty states voted because Alaska and Hawaii became states during this election cycle. Although the 50 states voted, the District of Columbia did not participate in this election. This was also the first election where Kennedy received most of the electoral votes while the Nixon took most of the states. The key issues during this time were Sputnik and the Race to Space between the United States and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/stem-ed-resources/race-to-space.html">"the Soviet Union."</a> <br><br> This election cycle featured the new concept of televised debates. Candidates benefitted from the idea of "free media." John F. Kennedy was a junior U.S. Massachusetts Senator and the Democrat front-runner. Vice President Richard Nixon was the Republican front-runner. Kennedy received votes from many who were upset by the Republican Party’s handling of the economic recession of 1957-1958. Kennedy was also the first Roman Catholic president which gained him new Catholic votes. He is the youngest person ever to be elected as President. Kennedy’s campaign skills concentrated on swing states which allowed him to gain essential electoral votes. Nixon on the other hand, campaigned in all 50 states.<br><br>Kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote and Nixon won 49.5 percent out of more than 68 million votes cast. Kennedy earned 112,827 votes more than Nixon. The key states that in this election that had slim margins were Illinois and Texas. Kennedy was only 43 years old and was the youngest person elected to be president.</p>

     <p class="nixontext"><br><br>Election Day: Tuesday November 5th, 1968<br><br>This election occurred during a time of deep division within the country. The Republican nominee was former vice president Richard Nixon. He defeated the Democratic nominee, incumbent vice president Hubert Humphrey. The election year's key issues were the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. There were also mass protests and opposition to the Vietnam War and the Tet Offensive which were both occurring during the election cycle. Protests across the country were occurring at universities and colleges. There were also violent police relations and confrontations with the public. Richard Nixon’s campaign promised “law and order” across the nation.<br><br>This was the first presidential election after the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This act allowed for “mass enfranchisement of racial minorities throughout the country, especially in the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act">South</a>."<br><br> Nixon won the popular vote by a lead of 812,415 votes.but won a large portion of the Electoral College. Nixon became the first non-incumbent vice president to be elected president. This election is also attributed to brekaing the New Deal Coalition which was a collection of interest groups and organizations that supported the New Deal. The coalition had been popular in presidential politics for 36 years. Nixon would win reelection in 1972 but would leave office in 1974 because of the Watergate scandal.</p>

Carter focused on the fact that he was an outsider from Washington politics while Ford pushed the idea of a “Rose Garden strategy.” He wanted to show the American people he was an experienced leader and prepared official to be the president. Carter was thought to be politically weak amongst the nation but he played to his strength of being a naval officer and agribusinessman. He also played on the idea of "trust." This idea was much needed because many within the United States because many had lost trust during the Watergate scandal and the Vietnam War.<br><br>The issues of the day that put Ford in a poor position were the poor economy, the fall of South Vietnam and his unpopular pardon of Nixon.

    The incumbent Republican President George W. Bush defeated the Democratic Senator from Massachusetts, John Kerry. Since 1988, this is the only presidential election where the Republican candidate won the popular vote.<br><br>
    Despite Bush gaining popularity after his response to the terrorist attacks on September 11th, 2001, his popularity declined significantly between 2001 and 2004. A major issue at the time was foreign policy. Some of his foreign policy issues included <a href="https://2001-2009.state.gov/s/ct/rls/wh/6947.htm">War on Terrorism</a> and the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/iraq-war-2003-web-archive/about-this-collection/"> 2003 Invasion of Iraq</a> There were several domestic issues that were major talking points during this election such as the economy, health care, abortion, same-sex marriage and stem cell research.<br><br>
    Bush won by a 35 electoral votes and took 50.7% of the popular vote. He was the first candidate since 1988 election to win over 50% of the popular vote as well as to win the overall vote. He won over 3 million more votes than Kerry. His victory was the first time that major party nominee won a presidential election without winning any electoral votes from the Northeast. </p>

    <p class="bidentext"><br><br>Election Day: Tuesday November 3rd, 2020<br><br>
    The Democrat nominee was former president Joe Biden who defeated Republican incumbent President Donald Trump.<br><br>Trump was the first president since 1992 to fail to win re-election to a second term. The 2020 election saw the highest voter turnout since 1900. Biden received the most votes ever cast for a candidate in a United States presidential election with 78 million votes being cast for the candidate. <br><br>
    Biden’s running mate, Kamala Harris who is a Senator from California, is the first African-American, first Asian-American and first female vice president elect.
    The issues of this debate were the Covid-19 pandemic, civil unrest, race inequality, police brutality, the confirmation of Supreme Court justices and the Affordable Care Act.<br><br>With the Covid-19 pandemic, the election had a record number of ballots cast early and by mail. Some swing states delayed vote counting and reporting from the large amount of mail in ballots cast which led to major news outlets delaying the president elect announcement until November 7th. <br><br>The votes of the Electoral college for president and vice president are scheduled to be formally cast by the presidential electors on December 14th, 2020 and officially counted by Congress on January 6th, 2021. </p>
